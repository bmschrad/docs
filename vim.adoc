= Vim Notes

A place to keep tips, tricks and pluging while learning about VIM

== General notes
* Buffers
** `:bd #` switches back to last buffer like windows Alt-Tab also called alternate buffer
** `:buffdo` to execute a command over all buffers
** Args List
*** Normally created when passing in a list of files on vim startup but can be add\removed manaully
*** Used sequensially like a linked pointer list where normal buffers are more randomly jumped to
*** `:n` moves to the next file in the argument list
*** `:wn` saves file and moves to next file in argument list
*** `:rewind` returns to first file in args list
* Windows
** A view onto the buffers, multiple windows can see the same buffer
** `ctrl-wx` swap windows (useful if you are just referencing)
** `ctrl-wc` close windows
** `ctrl-wo` close all other windows
